MicroEmacs
----------

This is an experimental reimplementation of a terminal-based editor
inspired by MicroEmacs. It is written in C and uses the ncurses
library for screen handling.

The purpose of this project is to provide a small, lightweight, and
fast editor that runs in the terminal, with a structure simple enough
to be studied and extended. It is not intended to be a full Emacs
replacement, but rather a compact editor in the same spirit as
uEmacs of Linus Torvalds.

STATUS
------
Currently the editor can open and edit text files in a single buffer.
Basic cursor movement and simple editing commands are implemented.
Many features of Emacs or uEmacs are not yet present.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
 - A C compiler conforming to ISO C99 (tested with 'cc' and 'gcc').
 - The ncurses library must be installed.

BUILDING
--------
To build the editor, type:

    make

This will produce an executable named 'emacs'.

You can run it with:

    ./em filename

INSTALLATION
------------
To install the editor system-wide, run:

    make install

This will copy the 'emacs' executable to /usr/local/bin (or your
specified BINDIR in the Makefile). You may then run it from any
terminal prompt:

    em filename

CLEANING
--------
To remove object files and the binary:

    make clean
